<h1>Coolest Story Ever Series</h1>
<p>This is the Coolest Story Ever series. I made this series almost half a year ago, because it's a pretty good idea!</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever</h2>
<p>So there was this guy named cool dude and everyone thought he was cool, but then he fell off a boulder and he cried "n" stuff and got really sick. But then a dude named
mr. dude went back "n" time and broke the boulder and everyone was all nice and dandy. Cool dude became best friends with mr. dude until the boulder's brother, who was
named boulver, tried to capture mr. dude because boulder, who was boulver's sister, got pretty much murdered by mr. dude. But then cool dude and boulver fought
and cool dude won, so boulver returned to his place swearing to come back. And then that's where the story ends for now.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 2</h2>
<p>Cool dude is at a restaurant with mr. dude, and they are eating a cheeseburger and some fries. Then there is an earthquake, so cool dude and mr. dude have to stop it before
it destroys the entire town of dudeberg. So they run to the store and buy some tape, then they go into the middle of the earthquake, almost falling, trying to keep their
composure. They put a tiny piece of tape on the crack, and everything is restored to its former glory. But in the distance is boulver watching.
So then the duo goes back to their house ready for the next adventure.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 3</h2>
<p>Cool dude and mr. dude are playing their favorite video game, Mega Italian Brothers, a VERY original game, not plagiarizing another popular video game released by a
company that rhymes with gingento for the something entertain system... anyway, while they play the VERY original game, the Lanlung TV (a TV released by a VERY
original company that is not plagiarizing a different, more popular company) turns off the game and puts on a broadcast from XYZ News, definitely not plagiarizing. Anyway, the news
says there's going to be so much rain that if you stand outside for more than 5 seconds, you will collapse to the ground and almost not be able to move 
due to a tornadoâ€”then it cuts out. So the duo keeps playing the game, but then they get hungry. They look out the window to see if it's rainy and, uh, yeah, it's VERY
rainy. So they grab some pieces of paper and a stick to make an umbrella, then they walk to the store, buy some cheeseburgers and fries, and then they go back home.</p>
