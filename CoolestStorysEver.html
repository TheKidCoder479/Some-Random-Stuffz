<h1>Coolest Story Ever Series</h1>
<p>This is the Coolest Story Ever series. I made this series almost half a year ago, because it's a pretty good idea!</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever</h2>
<p>So there was this guy named cool dude and everyone thought he was cool, but then he fell off a boulder and he cried "n" stuff and got really sick. But then a dude named
mr. dude went back "n" time and broke the boulder and everyone was all nice and dandy. Cool dude became best friends with mr. dude until the boulder's brother, who was
named boulver, tried to capture mr. dude because boulder, who was boulver's sister, got pretty much murdered by mr. dude. But then cool dude and boulver fought
and cool dude won, so boulver returned to his place swearing to come back. And then that's where the story ends for now.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 2</h2>
<p>Cool dude is at a restaurant with mr. dude, and they are eating a cheeseburger and some fries. Then there is an earthquake, so cool dude and mr. dude have to stop it before
it destroys the entire town of dudeberg. So they run to the store and buy some tape, then they go into the middle of the earthquake, almost falling, trying to keep their
composure. They put a tiny piece of tape on the crack, and everything is restored to its former glory. But in the distance is boulver watching.
So then the duo goes back to their house ready for the next adventure.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 3</h2>
<p>Cool dude and mr. dude are playing their favorite video game, Mega Italian Brothers, a VERY original game, not plagiarizing another popular video game released by a
company that rhymes with gingento for the something entertain system... anyway, while they play the VERY original game, the Lanlung TV (a TV released by a VERY
original company that is not plagiarizing a different, more popular company) turns off the game and puts on a broadcast from XYZ News, definitely not plagiarizing. Anyway, the news
says there's going to be so much rain that if you stand outside for more than 5 seconds, you will collapse to the ground and almost not be able to move 
due to a tornado—then it cuts out. So the duo keeps playing the game, but then they get hungry. They look out the window to see if it's rainy and, uh, yeah, it's VERY
rainy. So they grab some pieces of paper and a stick to make an umbrella, then they walk to the store, buy some cheeseburgers and fries, and then they go back home.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 4: Part 1</h2>
<p>One day in Dudeburg, The iconic duo Cool Dude and Mr.Dude are watching some television. But while they watch their shows they get a knock on the door.
They say “Who is it?” no answer, and then 2 big rocks with spears come and take them away. The 2 rocks bring them to their master, Boulver. WHAT!?!?
Yes, Cooluvin Dudington and Sir Dudelin the 1st are now at my mercy! HOW DO YOU KNOW OUR REAL NAMES? It's so plain and simple isn't it? So many people, 
so little time. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US? I want you to rot in prison for the rest of your stupid juvenile lives! NOOOOOO, PLEASE WE’LL DO ANYTHING!
It's too late for that now. It’s. Too. Late.</p>

<h2>Coolest Story Ever 4: Part 2</h2>
<p>*Groan* When are we going to leave this prison Mr.Dude? I know Cool Dude, it's been 2 days already! Hmph,
having fun yet scum? No obviously not, LET US OUT! Tell me why I should do that? Uhhh, Because if you don't we’ll, we’ll! You’ll do what? You’ll do nothing,
HAHAHA! *Boulver rolls away* Wait, Mr.Dude while Boulver was talking, I noticed a vent at the top of the cell. We could escape! You're right Cool Dude, I’ll
push you up. Thanks, but it's really dusty up here but I'll pull you up too. *2 minutes later…* Ok I found the exit Mr.Dude. Wait, WHAT! EVERYTHING IS SO
DYSTOPIAN! We, we need to stop this, and I know how. Have you ever heard of the legendary diamond, supposedly it grants the users special abilities. WHAT, 
ok then we need to go to it. We need to go into the depths of the cornerstone cave. *15 minutes of exploring later…* NO WAY WE ACTUALLY FOUND IT! Let's
use it now! *OoOoOoOoOoO BOOM* Let's get this numbskull! Hey Boulver you finally found yourself a “worthy opponent”! What? How did you achieve this level of
power? No time for chit chat rock for brains, let's get him Mr.Dude! You imbeciles are no match for my zappers dude duo! Yes we are a match! Taste the power of my diamond! *OWW* Well taste the electrical power of my zappers! *YOWCH* That's it! Our finishing move! DIAMOND BLAST! *AHHHHH* *The attack was critical!* Wait wait, WE DID IT YES! As they scream in unison Boulver limp-rolls away while back with the duo… YEAH YEAH WE DID IT! YEAH WE DID- Freeze! Dont. move. A muscle. WHAT, THE SWAT TEAM? Yes you have unimaginable amounts of power we need to extract that diamond, and keep it in Area 51. Oh, Oh no…
